# Quantitative-Finance-And-Math
Python and matlab programs for the pricing of vanilla and exotic options using FDTD/MC simulations, credit risk of one or multiple companies (With and without correlation), Model calibration for implied volatility using Newton's Method. Delta and Gamma hedging with the cumulative distribution of the P&L, Value at risk. Heston Model and calibration (with closed-form solution and MC simulations). As well  as Merton jump process (jumps following a poisson distribution) and call valuation in the presence of randomly distributed jump.
This depo also contains my graduation thesis on the spectral decomposition of a Sturm-Liouville operator, although it's only available in french for now :(.
It also contains some extreme values study on insurance portfolio data, we model a data set X using Gaussian/GEV/GPD distribution and find the best tail distribution fitting model using least-squares on the rescaled cumulative distribution function, which is pretty much equivalent to a Kolmogorov-Smirnoff test.
I will (hopefully) keep feeding this depository throughout the year with more content as I learn more and more !
