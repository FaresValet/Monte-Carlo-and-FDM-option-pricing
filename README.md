# Quantitative-Finance-And-Math
Python and matlab programs for the pricing of vanilla and exotic options using Finite-Differences/Monte-Carlo simulations or closed-form solution, as well as  Model calibration for volatility/VasicekYield/Dupire Model using various optimisation algorithms such as Levenberg-Marquardt. Most of the calibration is done in the non-linear least-squares sense.
Delta and Gamma hedging with the cumulative distribution of the P&L, Value at risk.
Heston Model and calibration (with closed-form solution and MC simulations). As well  as Merton jump process (jumps following a poisson distribution) and call valuation in the presence of randomly distributed jump.
This depo also contains my graduation thesis on the spectral decomposition of Sturm-Liouville operator and the determination of its resolvent/some numerical analysis, although it's only available in french for now :(.
It also contains some extreme value analysis on insurance portfolio data, we basically model a data set X using Gaussian/GEV/GPD distribution and find the best tail distribution fitting model using least-squares on the rescaled cumulative distribution function, which is pretty much equivalent to a Kolmogorov-Smirnoff test.
I will (hopefully) keep feeding this depository throughout the year with more content as I learn more and more !
